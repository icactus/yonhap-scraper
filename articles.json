The project which began in 2021 with a plan to build 50,000 homes in Pyongyang is a high-priority issue for Kim and is seen as a move to consolidate the regime and appease public sentiment by timing the completion with Kim Il-sung's birthday. Kim's commitment to housing is key, and her analysis of the materials and architectural styles used, as well as the socio-economic impact of new housing on Pyongyang residents, could be enhanced by this report.",
