The textbooks, intended as guidelines for unification education, detail the Yoon administration's policies over 10 pages and dedicate 4 pages to the '8·15 Unification Doctrine,' even though the policy has not been actively pursued and is arguably obsolete. This raises concerns about the appropriateness of including such content in educational materials for schools, given the changed political context and lack of North Korean engagement.",
