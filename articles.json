While some experts believe this meeting is likely and would send a strong signal of resistance against the West, others suggest China may be wary of aligning too closely with North Korea and Russia due to North Korea's nuclear provocations and increasingly hostile stance toward South Korea. This dynamic highlights the complex relationships and potential tensions within the North Korea-China-Russia triangle, which is of high interest to the professor.",
