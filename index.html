It analyzes how Choe's allies have risen to key positions and the consequences of the weakening system of checks and balances. The report indicates Kim Jong-un has used Choe to manage economic challenges and international relations, but the concentration of power in one person could negatively affect the regime's stability. The disappearance of the role of figures such as Kim Yo-jong also leaves more room for Choe's power.</div>
