        <div class="summary">This analysis focuses on the growing influence of an 'unofficial' elite network led by Choe Ryong-hae and the potential consequences for the Kim Jong-un regime. The report suggests that the expansion of Choe's network and the erosion of checks and balances could negatively impact regime stability. The article notes the decline of purges and the resilience of officials criticized by Kim Jong-un, possibly reflecting Choe's influence and the need for stability amid economic challenges, which could prove to be an interesting challenge to the system down the line.</div>
