        <div class="quote">A letter of loyalty to State Affairs Commission Chairman Kim Jong-un was adopted</div>
        <div class="summary">The 9th April Spring People's Art Festival, held in Pyongyang to celebrate the 113th anniversary of Kim Il-sung's birth, closed on April 17th. High-ranking officials such as Ju Chang-il, a department head of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, attended the closing ceremony. The adoption of a letter pledging allegiance to Kim Jong-un is a familiar, predictable move but its continued presence highlights the personality cult surrounding the Kim family and the regime's reliance on ideological control.</div>

        <div class="summary">North Korea is reportedly recalling State Security Department (SSD) agents dispatched abroad due to corruption allegations and strengthening selection and training processes for future personnel. A directive mandates weekly ideological and work reviews and written reports from the agents. Those from border regions or with prior overseas experience are being excluded due to potential compromise. The emphasis on rooting out corruption and ensuring loyalty reflects a deeper concern about maintaining regime control and preventing further erosion of state authority.</div>

        <div class="summary">The Ministry of Unification published new unification textbooks focusing on former President Yoon Suk-yeol's North Korea policies, including the '8·15 Unification Doctrine', despite Yoon's impeachment. The textbook details Yoon's policies, allocating significant space to the '8·15 Unification Doctrine,' even though the policy is no longer valid. The subtle change in wording regarding Kim Jong-un's daughter, Ju-ae, and the possibility of a fourth-generation succession highlights the ongoing speculation and analysis surrounding the Kim family's dynastic rule, something of interest to women's studies and NK leadership in general.</div>

The order directs a review of forced labor in seafood supply chains, which could impact North Korean workers exploited in Chinese fishing operations. This aligns with reports of North Korean laborers facing exploitative conditions in Chinese fisheries to earn foreign currency for the regime.</div>
