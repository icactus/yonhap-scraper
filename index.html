        <div class="quote">The trial procedure, which was suspended on December 13 last year when Representative Lee filed a motion to recuse the judge of the then Criminal Division 11 (Chief Judge Shin Jin-woo), is expected to resume after about four months</div>
        <div class="summary">The trial of Lee Jae-myung, leader of the Democratic Party, related to the 'North Korea remittance bribery case' has resumed after being suspended for four months due to a judge recusal request. The case involves allegations that Lee, during his tenure as Gyeonggi Province governor, had Kim Seong-tae, former chairman of Ssangbangwool Group, pay the costs for Gyeonggi Province's smart farm project and Lee's planned visit to North Korea. Lee denies the charges. This case is especially interesting due to the potential implications for inter-Korean relations and the ongoing political conflict in South Korea.</div>
