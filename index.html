        <div class="summary">A North Korean defector, identified as Mr. A, was arrested in Thailand for scamming other defectors by posing as a broker who could help their families escape from North Korea. He allegedly took 130 million won from two victims over 61 instances, promising assistance but failing to deliver. Mr. A exploited online cafes frequented by defectors, building false trust. This case highlights the vulnerability of defectors to scams and the challenges they face in helping their families.</div>

        <div class="summary">North Korea maintains the longest mandatory military service in the world, with terms potentially reaching up to 13 years. While the official service period has fluctuated over time, recent reports suggest that some soldiers still serve around 10 years. Unlike many other countries with conscription, North Korean soldiers spend a significant portion of their service engaged in non-military activities such as construction and agriculture. The investigation reveals the extreme length of military service and the associated hardships faced by North Korean soldiers, particularly those deployed overseas.</div>

She argues that North Korea's nuclear status is a result of external threats and the evolving global security landscape, and that attempts to revive the concept of denuclearization are a denial of North Korea's sovereignty. The statement could be seen as an indication of the regime's response to international pressure and its commitment to further developing its nuclear arsenal.</div>
