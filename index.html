The official suggests Russia might claim the areas where North Korean troops are deployed as 'Russian land' under Russian law, similar to how they conducted the operation in Kursk, wearing Russian military uniforms. The deployment is hypothesized as a possible bargaining chip for North Korea to gain further support from Russia for its nuclear program, and demonstrates an escalation in NK's involvement.</div>

While the scholar acknowledges the difficulty in finding a suitable test site, he believes it is possible to conceal the event through deception, a notion that has faced criticism for being irresponsible given South Korea's standing and the technical challenges of concealing nuclear tests. The proposal might be useful if combined with a study of how nuclear accidents are portrayed in DPRK state media, but the claim that they could simply lie about it is quite concerning.</div>
