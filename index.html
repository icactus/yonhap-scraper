It also notes that North Korea views the relationship with the South as one between 'two hostile countries' and underscores the importance of possible North Korea-U.S. talks as a variable in the situation.</div>

A substantial portion of Americans believe the U.S. would not intervene, while South Koreans are far more confident in U.S. support, including potential nuclear deployment. This divergence in perception highlights the risk of over-reliance on the US and a future strain on the US-Korean relationship.
