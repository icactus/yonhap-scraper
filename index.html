        <div class="summary">Kim Jong-un attended the completion ceremony of the third phase of the Hwasong District, a 'new town' project in Pyongyang, emphasizing his focus on improving people's lives, particularly as housing construction continues. The project which began in 2021 with a plan to build 50,000 homes in Pyongyang is a high-priority issue for Kim and is seen as a move to consolidate the regime and appease public sentiment by timing the completion with Kim Il-sung's birthday. Kim's commitment to housing is key, and her analysis of the materials and architectural styles used, as well as the socio-economic impact of new housing on Pyongyang residents, could be enhanced by this report.</div>

        <div class="summary">Kim Jong-un did not visit the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where Kim Il-sung's body is enshrined, on Kim Il-sung's birthday (Day of the Sun) for the third year in a row. While he resumed visits in 2021 and 2022, this absence follows a trend of reduced visits to the Palace for major anniversaries, suggesting a shift towards downplaying ancestor worship and establishing his own independent authority. Kim's pattern of attendance at the Kumsusan Palace is a useful proxy for examining subtle shifts in how Kim Jong-un wants to be viewed relative to his predecessors.</div>
