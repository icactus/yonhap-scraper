The Rodong Sinmun emphasizes Kim Jong-un's role in developing Juche ideology, presenting his policies, such as the new era's Five Party Construction Lines and the ideology of the Second National Defense Industrial Revolution, as scientific and practical guidelines. This relentless reiteration of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un's authority and the call for unwavering support for the leader's ideology are indicative of the DPRK's ongoing efforts to maintain regime stability and consolidate power through ideological indoctrination and propaganda.</div>

It suggests that while Russia may be eager to showcase solidarity against Western sanctions, China might be hesitant to publicly align with North Korea due to concerns about its nuclear provocations and strained relations. Kim Jong-un's potential attendance would provide him with a platform to appear alongside world leaders, but his preference for bilateral talks might make him reluctant.</div>

        <div class="quote">According to the report 'Changes in the Power Structure within the North Korean Elite and Implications' by Legislative Researcher Lee Seung-yeol of the National Assembly Research Service on the 12th, the phenomenon of power monopolization has emerged, with Choe Ryong-hae's close associates advancing to key positions in the party, government, and military since he became the Director of the Organization and Guidance Department in 2017.</div>
        <div class="summary">This article analyzes the growing influence of an informal elite organization led by Choe Ryong-hae within the North Korean power structure and its potential impact on the stability of Kim Jong-un's regime. The report suggests that Choe's consolidation of power has weakened checks and balances within the system, as key positions are filled with his loyalists, leading to the absence of accountability. The analysis points to the potential risks of such a concentration of power, as it could undermine the very principles of control and surveillance that underpin the leadership system, potentially leading to long-term instability and posing challenges to the existing power dynamics.</div>
